# Exercise 1

## Create an AWS account

During this event we're going to be using Amazon Web Services, or AWS. AWS have provided us with &#36;50 worth of credit per student. This entire event is unlikely to cost more than a few dollars so the remaining credit is yours to use as you like.

If you've already got an AWS account skip to the section on **Applying Your Credit**.

### Sign Up
